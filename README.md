Tic Tac Toe
==

Game [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) implemented on Android Platform using Kotlin (*ver. 1.1*). By default grid 4x4 is used, but dimensions can be changed by simply changing **ColumnCount** & **RowsCount** constants in **MainActivity.kt**, where entire game mechanic is implemented.
